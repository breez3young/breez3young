## Biography
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a PhD student at Tsinghua University, fortunate to work closely with [Dr. Chenjia Bai](https://baichenjia.github.io/). I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Automation at Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. Li Li.
## Research Interests
âœ¨ I aim to develop a general world model that can empower agents with intelligent, generalizable and interpretable decision-makinig capability. To this end, I mainly focus on:
- Reinforcement Learning and its applications in the real world
- Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
- Generative Modeling in RL, especially `Transformer` and `Diffusion Model`
- Foundation models for reasoning and decision-making (i.e. Embodied AI)
- Building Efficient World Models

ðŸ˜„ I'm open to any kind of collaborations.
